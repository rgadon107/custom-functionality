# Distribution Directory

This directory holds the optimized and compressed, i.e. minified, stylesheet and script(s).

## When to minify script and styles

When the combined size of plugin script or style files exceeds 10KB, minify the scripts and styles. This will reduce 30 - 40% of the file size and improve performance on 3G/4G network connections.

Place those minified scripts and styles in the `/assets/dist` folder.
